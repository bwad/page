# Sprint 1

---

The purpose of this sprint is to provide a useful tool for exprerimenting with jquery.

- Single project template (default)
- Page templates for some common page layouts (maybe 5 to start)
- Partial templates for common elements of default page templates (maybe 3 to start)


###Create Project (new command)
Create a working new project that provides examples of most (all?) of the features available, or at least a starting point for using them.

- Create default project structure
- Fill in default 'lib' components
- Add default files (html/php/js/css/...)
- Consider support for tailoring of the above based on template?

###Add A Partial
The idea is to generate partials that can be used in the default projects components (index.html, etc.) based on templates of usefull pieces of a web page (i.e. login form, nav menu, etc.)

- where do partials go (outside of doc root?)
- listing available partial templates?
